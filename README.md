# supervised_machine_learning

#### Project Status: Finished

## Project Intro/Objective
Collection of different machine-learning techniques applied to a dataset about real-estate to predict prices.
The purpose of this project is to learn applying supervised machine-learning to real-life data.   
Data had to be explored, preprocessed and then used for model training and evaluation.

### Methods Used
* Linear Regression 
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Random Forest Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Data Visualization
* Gridsearch for tuning

### Technologies
* Python
  * pandas, jupyter, sklearn, seaborn
* Supervised and unsupervised machine-learning techniques from sklearn package

## Project Description
The data used is freely available:
* Housing Data -> [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).  
  
Main goals of the project:  
* Train and apply different ML models to get the best performance when predicting the price of houses based on the provided features. 
* Tune the models to minimize RMSE.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Make sure to have the following libraries in your environment:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - sklearn
    - seaborn
3. Go through the notebook to apply the different ML techniques, save the results to a dataframe, and compare performance.
